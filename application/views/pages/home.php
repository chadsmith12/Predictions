				<h3><strong><em>Welcome to Rounding 3rd Predictions!</em></strong></h3>
				<br />
				We provide a one stop database for you to insert your own predictions and view other predictions from other fans.
				Baseball fans are always trying to predict how their specific team will do during a 162 game season.  How their team 
				will pan out in their specific division.  You no longer have to keep track of this yourself.  Insert your predictions
				for the team, pitcher, and hitter, and they will be automatically added to a list of all the others.  Compare how you did
				to other people.  How close were you?  How far away were you?  Insert your predictions for the 2015 campaign now!
